text \<open>Syntax and Semantics of MiniSail. This is a kernel language for Sail, an instruction set architecture specification language. 
The idea behind this language is to capture the key and novel features of Sail in terms of their syntax, typing rules and operational semantics
and to confirm that they work together by proving progress and preservation lemmas. We use the Nominal2 library to handle binding.
